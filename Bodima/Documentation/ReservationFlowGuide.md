# Bodima Reservation Flow - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The reservation system has been completely redesigned to prevent premature data saving and ensure atomic transactions. All reservation data is held in memory until payment succeeds, preventing partial reservations and data loss during navigation.

## Architecture

### ReservationStateManager (Singleton)
- **Purpose**: Centralized state management for the entire reservation flow
- **Location**: `/Core/ReservationStateManager.swift`
- **Key Features**:
  - Holds all reservation data in memory until payment completion
  - Validates data integrity before processing
  - Handles atomic reservation creation + payment + confirmation
  - Automatic cleanup after successful completion

### Data Flow

```
HomeView ‚Üí DetailView ‚Üí ReserveView ‚Üí PaymentView
    ‚Üì         ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì
   Browse ‚Üí Initialize ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Finalize
                ‚Üì           ‚Üì            ‚Üì
            State      Memory      Database
           Created     Storage     Persistence
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. DetailView.swift
**Changes Made:**
- Added `@StateObject private var reservationStateManager = ReservationStateManager.shared`
- Modified "Reserve Now" button to initialize state instead of immediate navigation
- Removed direct reservation creation

**Key Code:**
```swift
Button(action: {
    reservationStateManager.startReservationFlow(
        habitation: habitation,
        locationData: locationData,
        featureData: featureData
    )
    navigateToReserve = true
})
```

### 2. ReserveView.swift
**Changes Made:**
- Removed all parameters from struct (now uses shared state)
- Connected date pickers to ReservationStateManager
- Removed immediate reservation API calls
- Added calendar integration without data persistence
- Added navigation safety checks

**Key Code:**
```swift
DatePicker("", selection: Binding(
    get: { reservationData?.checkInDate ?? Date() },
    set: { newDate in
        reservationStateManager.updateReservationDates(
            checkInDate: newDate,
            checkOutDate: reservationData?.checkOutDate ?? Date().addingTimeInterval(86400 * 30)
        )
    }
))
```

### 3. PaymentView.swift
**Changes Made:**
- Removed all parameters from struct (now uses shared state)
- Added comprehensive validation before payment
- Single finalization process that handles everything atomically
- Proper state cleanup after success

**Key Code:**
```swift
private func handlePayment() {
    // Validate all data
    let validation = reservationStateManager.validateReservationData()
    if !validation.isValid {
        showAlert(title: "Validation Error", message: validation.errorMessage)
        return
    }
    
    // Process everything atomically
    reservationStateManager.finalizeReservation { success, errorMessage in
        // Handle result
    }
}
```

## Data Models

### PendingReservationData
```swift
class PendingReservationData: ObservableObject {
    let habitation: EnhancedHabitationData
    let locationData: LocationData?
    let featureData: HabitationFeatureData?
    
    @Published var checkInDate: Date
    @Published var checkOutDate: Date
    @Published var selectedPaymentCard: PaymentCard?
    @Published var calendarEventCreated: Bool = false
}
```

## Flow States

### 1. Initialization State
- User clicks "Reserve Now" in DetailView
- ReservationStateManager creates PendingReservationData
- Navigation to ReserveView

### 2. Configuration State
- User selects check-in/check-out dates
- Data stored in memory only (no API calls)
- Calendar event creation (optional)
- Navigation to PaymentView

### 3. Finalization State
- User selects payment method
- Comprehensive validation of all data
- Atomic process: Create Reservation ‚Üí Process Payment ‚Üí Confirm Booking
- Success: Clear state and return to home
- Failure: Show error, keep state for retry

## Error Handling

### Validation Checks
1. **Date Validation**: Check-out must be after check-in
2. **Future Dates**: Check-in cannot be in the past
3. **Payment Method**: Must be selected before finalization
4. **User Profile**: Must be available for reservation creation

### Navigation Safety
- ReserveView checks for valid state on appear
- PaymentView checks for valid state on appear
- Automatic redirect if no reservation data exists

### Error Recovery
- Validation errors show specific messages
- Network errors allow retry without losing data
- Payment failures preserve state for retry
- Success automatically cleans up state

## Benefits

### For Users
- ‚úÖ No data loss when navigating back
- ‚úÖ Can change dates/payment method freely
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages with specific guidance
- ‚úÖ Atomic transactions (all or nothing)

### For Developers
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for reservation state
- ‚úÖ No partial reservations in database
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Easy to extend with new features

### For System
- ‚úÖ Reduced database clutter
- ‚úÖ Better error handling
- ‚úÖ Improved data integrity
- ‚úÖ Cleaner API usage patterns

## Testing Checklist

### Happy Path
- [ ] Navigate through entire flow successfully
- [ ] Verify reservation created in database
- [ ] Confirm payment processed
- [ ] Check reservation status updated
- [ ] Validate state cleanup

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Navigate back at each step
- [ ] Invalid date selections
- [ ] No payment method selected
- [ ] Network failures during payment
- [ ] User profile issues

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Multiple concurrent reservations
- [ ] App backgrounding during flow
- [ ] Memory pressure scenarios
- [ ] Calendar permission denied

## Debug Information

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:
- `üîç DEBUG - Starting reservation finalization process`
- `üîç DEBUG - Reservation created successfully with ID: {id}`
- `üîç DEBUG - Payment successful, confirming reservation`
- `üîç DEBUG - Reservation confirmed successfully`

Monitor console output for detailed flow tracking.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache reservation data for offline completion
2. **Multi-Property**: Support reserving multiple properties
3. **Partial Payments**: Support deposit + balance payment flow
4. **Booking Modifications**: Allow editing existing reservations
5. **Social Features**: Share reservation with friends

### Migration Notes
- Old reservation flow completely replaced
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Backward compatible with existing reservation data
- Can be rolled back by reverting to previous navigation pattern
